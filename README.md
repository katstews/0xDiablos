I remember coming across the challenge a month ago and instantly giving up because I had zero clue what any write ups meant. I had all the solutions right in front of me and yet I still could not understand it. I've done one buffer overflow challenge, and that was it. The challenge compared to this was much much easier. This challenge was a two step process.
